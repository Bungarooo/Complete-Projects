My greatest completed project I have worked on so far is of Monsterous Molecules. Unfortunately the game doesn't belong to me, so I can't share the codebase. Examples of contributions: implemented the save system, implemented a minimap system (ended up getting cut), implemented the assets provided by the artists and used them to build the levels. General game scripting (i.e. doors opening, some of the early versions of some bosses, room navigation manager, parts of the audio manager).
